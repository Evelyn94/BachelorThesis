Given the ads-b system relative to the existing radar air monitoring system, the advantages of transition from radar surveillance system to the ads-b system is a process of the trend of The Times.According to the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) implementation of the provisions on the next generation air transportation system, by 2020, all aircraft that want to fly through the US must be equipped with ads-b equipment .Due to the ads-b system haven't considered the safety and privacy issues in the beginning of design, therefore, study of ads-b security privacy is also becoming more and more urgent.The attacks ads-b system may face can be divided into active attack and passive attack, this topic mainly solve the problem of passive attack in privacy protection.This topic of privacy protection measures are of ads-b data encryption method.When it comes to encryption, the first problem is the choice of algorithm, ads-b message encryption algorithms need to meet and conform to the ads-b system ads-b message format features.Therefore, in view of these characteristics and comprehensive comparative analysis of various algorithms we have chosen FFX algorithm,one kind of the format preserving algorithm as the most suitable protection algorithm.According to the size of the chain of ads-b data immutable characteristics, message encryption can't change the length after encryption, and can't add any additional information to itself, so the bloated  asymmetric encryption algorithm is relatively disadvantage when compare to symmetric encryption algorithms.So FFX algorithm is a kind of symmetrical static algorithm with format protection properties.The encryption of ads-b message also face to a problem is that which parts of ads-b message can be encrypted and which parts cannot be encrypted or it will lead to the situation that ADS-B message cannot be decoded or the presence of the other abnormal situation.

After careful analysis and experiment, to satisfy the the purpose that to make aircraft anonymous which also means only encrypt ICAO24,one part of the ADS-B message which is the only Identity of the flight to irrelevant personnel in order to achieve the privacy protection ,to encrypt this part of ads-b message does not affect decoding and won't hide trajectory to damage navigation safety, and the encryption efficiency is very high, so the scheme can be put into practical application.Finally, in order to examine the results of encryption, the system also implements the ads-b message decoding and visualization, to make the position information and the only identity of flight which encode in the ADS-B message can be displayed on the map in an intuitive way.
